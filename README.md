# Coding 2024-Fix - Cobblestone Software Assessment

This project was developed as part of a **coding assessment** for **Cobblestone Software**.

The application demonstrates:
- Reading data from a **CSV file**
- Displaying data in **GridViews**
- Filtering data by **randomly selected creature types**
- Displaying filtered data in **two separate grids**

Additionally, I implemented a **random generation feature** to dynamically select different creature types and display them in two separate tables.
