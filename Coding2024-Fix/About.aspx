    <h2>About This Project</h2>

    <p>This project is developed as part of a coding assessment for <strong>Cobblestone Software</strong>.</p>

    <p>
        It demonstrates reading data from a CSV file and displaying it in GridViews with filtering functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, I implemented a <B>random generation feature</B> that dynamically selects two different creature types from the dataset on every page load and displays their filtered data in two separate grids.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project uses ASP.NET Web Forms(.NET Framework 4.8.1) and follows best practices for readability, maintainability, and functionality.
